## A weird disease/infection plugin written in Kotlin
This plugin aims to add a variety of random infections to your survival experience.

Note: This will be an opt-out experience, if you do not like what this plugin does, you can turn it off completely!

These include:
 - Zombie infections: Brainsssssss...?
    - When a player is infected, they will burn in the daylight and require "brains" (killing other mobs, or players) to stay alive.
    - When a passive mob gets infected they will attack other passive mobs and non-infected players.
    

 - Airborne/Transmitted infections: Sometimes the world is just out to get you
   - there will be various airborne infections, namely:
      - Radiation (You will die slowly)
      - Flu (You are pretty sick, but you won't die)
      - Covid-19 (Everyone's favourite, you'll probably die)
